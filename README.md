Hi there 👋 Wanna know who am I?  I am a Developer who likes programming and technology.  Everyday I learn new things and always get surprised of how dedicated and persistent I can be about new challenges. Computers are a passion that I find out during my first dbase classes and became a significant part of my job, studies and hobbies ever since.  I am constantly applying different approaches to explore and make sense of data, like Machine Learning and information visualization techniques. I am also a Deep Learning enthusiast avid to build applications with it.  Currently I'm a masters student in Applied Mathematics at Fundação Getúlio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro and work as a part time researcher at the Center for Regulatory and Infrastructure Studies in the same institution.  Skills / Interests: Python, Julia, R, C++, JavaScript, NodeJS, D3.js, HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, SQL, Docker, Shell Scripting Languages, Linux.
